# Lung-Cancer-Detection
Its a Machine learning project where I used different python libraries like Pandas,Numpy,Matplotlib.At first, I collected data and  preprocess the data, training the data and testing the data and finally we predict the percentage chances of affecting the lung cancer based on machine earning Algorithms.
